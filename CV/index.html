                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <p>I was born on July 24, 2001, in a small central Ukraine town called Cherkasy. My father was a software developer, while my mother worked as a piano accompanist 
                    <br>in a children choir.</p>

                <p>The first school I went to was the 
                    Cherkasy specialized school No. 17, 
                    where I studied until the 8th grade. There I gained a good knowledge of English and learned German a little. Also, I had already decided that I want to become a software developer, so I have taken an interest in IT.</p>

                <h3>Moving to the Kyiv</h3>
                <p>In 2014 my family and I moved to the capital of Ukraine. That was my 8th grade, so I started learning in the Kyiv Engineering Gymnasium where my specialization was informatics and math. Within 4 years I learned how to work with text and data in MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher, processed photos and created pictures in Paint and Adobe Photoshop. Also, I started learning programming from scratch with Pascal, built web-sites with HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h3>University</h3>
                <p>In 2018 I went to an IT specialty at the Heat power Faculty of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. During the first two courses, I gained deep knowledge of maths, numeric methods, physics, algorithms, humanities, and programming. I deepened my knowledge of HTML, CSS and functional programming with JavaScript. Learned C, C++ and wrote a few coursework - a 2D video game and the R&D accounting app.
                    Simultaneously, I spent my free time extending my hard skills with Java, AWS and game developing using Unity Engine.</p>

            <h3>Achievements and Goals</h3>
            <p>For now, I have a good knowledge of C and Object-oriented programming with C++. I learned a functional programming paradigm with JavaScript and the basics of CSS and HTML. At the basic level, I got acquainted with Java, Amazon Web Services, C# and game developing using Unity game engine, processing data with Python. Also, I have some experience of working in a team.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to deeply improve my knowledge of making Web-based applications with Java and AWS. In general, Iâ€™d like to keep developing all of my technical and soft skills and keep on learning new technologies forever.</p>
